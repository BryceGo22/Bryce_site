                <p>Hi there! I’m Bryce, a computer engineer with a passion for exploring how technology can enhance the things I love—whether it's video games, storytelling, or sports. I’m particularly drawn to the intersection of tech and creativity, where I can develop smarter game systems, craft AI-driven adventures for D&D, or even use data to get an edge in fantasy football. I’ve always been fascinated by how technology can bring fantasy worlds to life, create immersive gaming experiences, or even analyze a game-winning play, and that’s what keeps me excited about what I do.</p>
                <p>I enjoy sharing my experiences, whether it’s talking about game design, AI in fantasy, or just exchanging ideas with others who are passionate about tech. My journey has taken me through some pretty cool projects—from working on AI-driven software at UC San Diego to developing full-stack applications during my time at San Diego Supercomputer Center. These experiences have shaped how I think about technology and how it can be used to create something truly engaging.</p>
                <p>Most recently, I’ve been honing my skills at the San Diego Supercomputer Center as a Research Software Engineer. I’ve also worked on a variety of exciting projects during my studies at UC San Diego. As I continue to explore new opportunities, I’m eager to find roles where I can continue to innovate at the intersection of technology and creativity. If your company is hiring, let’s chat!</p>
                <p>Right now, I’m focused on projects that bring together my love for gaming, fantasy, and sports with my technical skills. Whether it’s planning the next epic quest for my D&D group, or using machine learning to predict outcomes in my fantasy football league, I’m always looking for new ways to combine my interests and make those ideas a reality. I’m excited about the potential of technology to enhance these experiences and to create something truly engaging, whether it's in a game, on the field, or at the table.</p>
